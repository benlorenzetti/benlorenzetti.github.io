<h1>Repairs and Improvements</h1>
<p>My goals for 405 W. Alexander St. are to serve as a good long term
  investment in one of my favorite neighborhoods and build a
  competitive property but provide slightly below market rates to quiet
  tenants near the submarine base.
  I am proud to share the improvements made and this page also
  records the expenses for analysis.
</p>
<p> Based on rental prices in the area, the first six corrective
  measures/improvements togther are estimated to improve the rental
  quality by about $150/month, which is just a baseline for estimating
  an admittedly fuzzy ROI. Prices below do not factor in 7% sales tax.

<h2 id="washer-dryer">Washer and Dryer (2021)</h2>
<p> I am a big fan of vertically stacked laundry and dryers, and no product
  epitomizes this like the GE Spacemaker. It was hard to get during Covid and
  the door to the laundry room and the existing cabinetry had to be removed
  to get it in, but ultimately this is going to reclaim space in this little
  1160 ft<sup>2</sup> home.

  Kingsbay Drycleaners and 24 Hour Laundry Mat</a> is conveniently
  located next to a McGarvey's Wee Pub but is too far away to walk.
  Assuming most apartments charge $50/month for a washer and dryer,
  this investment probably will have a positive ROI if there are no
  major maintenance issues for 3 years.

<h2 id="driveway">Driveway Extension (2022-)</h2>
<p> The original single lane driveway feels right for this single
  family home but would be inconveniant for two or more
  relatively independent renters. The extension allows two vehicles
  to park easily without coordination and three to park with
  minimal coordination.
</p>
<p> Construction was based on rules of thumb from
  <a href="https://www.nitterhousemasonry.com/blog/best-paver-base-material/">
    Nitterhouse Masonry</a>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>6 to 8 inch subbase thickness for vehicle traffic in granular-clay/cohesive soil</li>
  <li>4&nbsp;tons&nbsp;subbase&nbsp;material/100&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;8&nbsp;inches&nbsp;thick</li>
  <li>lowest layer uses 0.75&nbsp;inch (average) diameter gravel</li>
  <li>leveling layer of sand 1&nbsp;to&nbsp;1.5&nbsp;inches thick</li>
  <li>a 1/48 rain runoff slope (translated through all layers)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first phase laid a usable subbase of gravel over a
  522&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup> area plus a runoff route. The second phase
  will finalize compaction, lay sand and traditional brick pavers
  over the gravel and potentially add a concrete paver tire lane.

<h2>Attic Access</h2>
<p> The attic was gross with old junk, worn paper and crumbling cardboard,
  ripe for bugs. It is hard to get around on the rafters due to the low pitch
  of the roof. Perhaps this is why the living room ceiling fan was so
  precariously mounted, held in place solely by rusting 1/16" wire wrapped
  around an ascanse 2x6.
</p>
<p> The attic looks much better with all of the trash removed and a few
  extra studs and mixed 1/2 and 3/4" plywood installed for easier access to
  the central utilities despite the low pitch. I am happy to have found the
  lighting fixture deficiency before it found me, hopefully there are no
  other problems going unnoticed. On account of the lighting fixture alone,
  I consider the attic access improvement a good investment.
