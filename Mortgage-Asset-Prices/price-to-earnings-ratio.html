<h1>Price to Earnings Ratio</h1>
<p> The price to earnings ratio (P/E) is a commonly used measure of
	stock market prices. Another way this information is reported is
	earnings per share (EPS) together with the stock share price.
</p>
<p> The goal of the <a href="mortgage-calculator.html">mortage calculator</a>
	is comparing real estate investments to stocks. The graph below shows
	the results of the real estate model over the last 40 years compared to
	the S&amp;P 500. For more information on yellow and red curves, they are
	is the culmination of the
	<a href="index.html">mortgage calculator series</a>.
</p>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<p> There are three anecdotal assumptions noted on the graph and a
	normalization scalar <em>c'</em> (the same as in the
	<a href="price-to-rent-ratio.html">P/R ratio</a>).
	All of these could be more tightly quantified with more data by professional
	researchers, economists, or companies.
  Nonetheless, the results seem pretty well correlated and believable in
	the magnitude of differences: family home ownership
	returns seem to have been more than twice (2.75x) the stock
	market historically. About 25% of this seems to be due to active
	property management vs. passive stock holding and the other 75% due
	to the use of debt.
</p>
<h2>Code</h2>
<p> The MATLAB (or Octave) script
	<a href="../Economic-Data/peratio.m"><span class="code">peratio.m</span></a>
	used to make this plot is available to my readers as a tool,
	free under an MIT license. It relies on functions from my
	<a href="../Economic-Data/matlab.html">data scripting library</a>.
	Up to date data is available at the sources cited below.
</p>
<h2>Hashed Freddie Mac Data</h2>
<p> Single family mortgage data is publicly available from
	<a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/research/datasets/sf_loanlevel_dataset.page">
	Freddie Mac</a> under limited terms and conditions.
	For research purposes, running the model with the Freddie Mac data produces
	similar results with fewer assumptions.
	These results are hashed onto the plot above.
</p>
<p class="code">
	...You may also use the Single-Family Loan-Level Dataset for academic or
	research purposes, and make your academic or research results and any related
	Derived Products available to the public, provided that any such distribution
	is solely for noncommercial purposes and further provided that the same does
	not include and cannot be used to derive or recreate any part of the
	Single-Family Loan-Level Dataset or to identify any specific individual as
	prohibited above...
