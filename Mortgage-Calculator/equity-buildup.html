<h1>Equity Buildup</h1>
<h2>Sep. 2021</h2>
<p> The <a href="mortgage-calculator.html">mortgage calculator</a>
  proved that mortgage principal and monthly payments (p) are
  related by an independent constant, set by interest rates (r)
	and loan period (N).
  The next <a href="index.html">three articles</a> used this
  to build a relationship between home prices and rent, but
  did not account for a major difference between borrowing and
  renting&mdash;building up equity in a home.
</p>
<img src="equity-buildup-summary.png">
<p> Similarly, the results show the inflation-adjusted equity buildup
	(&Sigma;n/p) is independent of the price tag and can be applied
	equivalently to any sized mortgage (&Proportional;p). The second significant
	result is the impact of inflation on the gains from the
	loan liability, making inflation-ajusted equity buildup much more biased
	towards a straight line that the exponential curve typically associated
	with mortgages due to paying off a growing portion of principal
	each month.
</p>
<img src="equity-buildup.png" width="100%">
<p> Unlike <a href="https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/">
	inferior mortgage calculators</a> with admittedly pretty,
  quasi-exponential interactive graphics, this site's calculator
	and articles emphasize the linear aspects of mortgages in
	the 21st Century. The
	<a href="leverage-ratio.html">next article</a> continues down
	this path by defining the leverage ratio and also accounting
	for closing costs, which are not included in the proof below.
</p>
<h2>Equity Buildup Proof</h2>
<p> Equity buildup is based on the same mortgage equations used in the
  <a href="mortgage-calculator.html">mortgage calculator</a>,
  where 'n' is the number of the month, 'N' the loan period, 'P0'
	initial loan principal, 'p' the monthly payment,
  and 'r' the monthly interest multiplication factor.
</p>
<img src="mortgage-calculator-summary.png">
<p> The real equity gained each month is due to the amount of principal
  being repayed (i.e. difference between principal remaining
  between months n-1 and n) and due to exposure to
  inflation/deflation (I%) of the remaining loan liability (Pn).
</p>
<img src="equity-delta.png">

<p> The sum of nominal gains from the month the liability was incurred
	to the nth month, for the general case:
</p>
<img src="equity-buildup-sum.png">
<p> All that remains is accounting for the possibility of 0% interest rates,
	(when the geometric series does not apply). This final equation
	describes the inflation-adjusted equity buildup due to the loan
	liability, the next article will account for closing
	costs and financing fees by defining an
	<a href="leverage-ratio.html">effective leverage ratio</a>.
</p>
<img src="equity-buildup-summary.png">

<p> One interesting results is that this equation devolves into a straight
	line if inflation rates equal interest rates. This will be
	explored further later in this <a href="index.html">series</a>.
	A second degenerate result is 0% inflation
	(<span style="white-space:nowrap;">i = 1</span>), where the equity
	buildup approaches R(N) at the end of the loan term.
